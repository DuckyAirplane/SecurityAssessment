Artemis Financial Security Report
Overview
This repository contains my Artemis Financial Security Report, demonstrating my ability to assess vulnerabilities and apply secure coding practices. I have included [insert document name] from Project One/Two, which highlights security risks and mitigation strategies.

Client & Software Requirements
Artemis Financial, a financial services company, needed a security assessment to identify vulnerabilities and improve software security.

Key Achievements
Identified vulnerabilities using static/dynamic analysis and secure coding best practices.
Strengthened security with input validation, encryption, and access controls.
Ensured functionality and security through code reviews, penetration testing, and automated scanning.
Tools & Best Practices
Security Tools: OWASP ZAP, SonarQube, SAST/DAST tools
Best Practices: Input sanitization, least privilege, secure authentication
Testing: Unit tests, regression testing, security scans
Value for Future Employers
This project showcases my skills in security assessment, secure coding, and risk mitigation, demonstrating my ability to protect software from threats.
